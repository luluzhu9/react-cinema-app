**Note:** There's a bug where the first screen upon loading/refreshing is the error page, but after clicking "Go back to home page" everything else is functional!

## About
This is a Udemy certificate course I completed called [Build a React & Redux App w/ CircleCI CI/CD, AWS & Terraform](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-modern-react-and-redux-app-with-circleci-cicd-aws/), where I created a Netflix-like web app and learned how to:
- set up a CI/CD pipeline using CircleCI
- use Redux for state management
- create AWS services using Terraform
- use AWS S3 and Cloudfront for storage and distribution
- integrate Slack, Sentry, Docker
- create error pages and loading animations
- and much more!

Overall, I learned a lot about DevOps and incorporating many technologies to automate and improve the development process, and will definitely use these skills in future projects!
